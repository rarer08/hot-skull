His skull blazed like a smoldering coal, and when he blinked, ash from his own thoughts drifted down to singe the back of his hands.
The Hot Skull didn’t bleed—instead, its cracked cranium oozed glowing, molten words that hissed “remember” as they seeped into the concrete.
She grabbed his scorching forehead, and her fingertips melted a little; his mind was a furnace, incinerating memories he’d never meant to keep.
The crowd screamed as the Hot Skull opened its mouth, and out poured not screams, but a swarm of tiny, fiery locusts that ate fear like candy.
His skull was a prison for a thousand burning voices, and every step he took shook loose a whisper that smelled like burnt hair and forgotten names.
When the Hot Skull laughed, its teeth glowed cherry-red, and the air around it warped—turning distant buildings into wobbly, melting shadows.
She pressed her ear to his searing scalp and heard galaxies burning: the Hot Skull didn’t just think—it consumed the very fabric of what was real.
The detective’s gun shook as he aimed; the Hot Skull’s eyes were two smoldering sockets, and in them, he saw his own future going up in flames.
It leaned in, skull radiating heat that curled the detective’s shirt collar, and said, “I don’t forget—I burn the forgetters into my bones.”
As the storm raged, the Hot Skull stood in the rain, and the water didn’t cool it—it turned to steam that carried visions of a world where everyone’s skulls glowed like his.
